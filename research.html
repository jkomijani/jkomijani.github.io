      <section>
        <p>My research is
        in the interdisciplinary area of computational physics,
        effective field theories (EFT), lattice gauge theory, and mathematical physics.
        </p>

        <p>
        During my Ph.D. studies in physics at Washington University in St. Louis,
        I had the unusual opportunity to work simultaneously
        on two completely independent subjects.
        Having two thesis advisors,
        Prof.
        <a href="https://academictree.org/physics/peopleinfo.php?pid=665247">
            Claude Bernard</a>
        and Prof.
        <a = href="https://academictree.org/physics/peopleinfo.php?pid=476157">
            Carl Bender</a>,
        I was able to work on diverse topics from lattice gauge theory
        to mathematical physics.
        During my postdoctoral research, I continued working on those topics.
        Moreover, I introduced a project to determine 
        <a href=#quark_masses>quark masses</a> with a novel method,
        and I employed different skills that I learned from my advisors
        in the project,
        which resulted to three related papers (a trilogy)
        and led to very precise determination of the masses of five of
        the six quarks found in Nature.</p>


        <p>On this page, you see a list of my scientific projects during my doctoral
        and postdoctoral research. I only mention the papers that I was one of
        the main coauthors with a significant amount of contribution, and I
        mainly describe my contribution to the papers.

        <p>A trilogy of papers describe my work on the determination of quark masses:

         </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>I describe this project as the one that I am most proud of.
        In ten seconds you understand why!
        This project was indeed a complex work in the interdisciplinary area of
        computational physics, effective field theories, lattice gauge theory,
        mathematical physics, and statistical analysis.
        I am proud because of two reasons.
        First, I proposed the idea from scratch; it was my own child.
        Second, although the idea looked very straightforward,
        its successful implementation required a diverse set of skills that,
        fortunately, I either had or learned.
        The work led to a very precise determination of the masses of five of
        the six quarks found in Nature and their ratios.</p>

        <p>Let me start with a comment that is not obvious for
        non-theoretical physicists. The conventional
        notion of the rest mass of an object, such as the Sun, the Earth,
        your smartphone, a piece of paper, or even an electron,
        cannot be straightforwardly used for particles like quarks that are
        confined in hadrons such as a proton.
        Because it requires a good deal of theoretical work, it is the job of
        theoretical physicists---not experimentalists---to <em>measure</em>
        (calculate) the masses of quarks.
        Theoretical physicists have developed their conventions, also called
        schemes, of defining and measuring the masses.
        The most common one is the so-called MS-bar scheme;
        people usually report their results in this particular scheme.
        Let me now present a chronological report of my idea of calculating
        quark masses.
        </p>

        <p>I started thinking about the idea when I was in St. Louis in the last
        year of my Ph.D. studies and proposed the idea in the Fall of 2015 when
        I went to Munich, as a postdoctoral researcher.
        The idea looked nice and simple, and my colleagues liked me working on
        it and determine the masses of quarks.
        As the devil always comes from details, I encountered many problems
        when I tried to implement the idea.</p>

        <p>The idea was novel and simple looking: generate data with lattice-QCD
        simulations, build a function based on effective field theories 
        to model the data, fit the function to the data,
        and finally, use the parameters of the fit function as well as a set of
        experimental inputs to determine the masses of quarks.
        From the numerical point of view, the most expensive part was
        the first part that required generating a large amount of lattice-QCD
        data. Fortunately, I did not even need to worry about this part because
        the MILC collaboration was generating the required data for a different
        project: determination of
        <a href=#decay_constants>decay constants</a> of heavy-light mesons.
        </p>

        <p>This project included several layers of analyses,
        starting from the analysis of lattice-QCD correlators,
        which was done by Doug. This was followed by a layer of
        analysis that included scale setting and determination of the ratio of
        light quark masses, namely the ratio of the average of the up and down
        quark masses to the strange quark mass. In a parallel process mainly
        led by Claude, the ratio of the up and down quark masses was
        determined using a lattice setup that included both QCD and QED
        effects.
        Those layers of analyses were common with the
        <a href=#decay_constants>decay constant</a> project.
        I was in charge of the next layers up to calculating the final
        results presented in the paper. Andreas, Antonio, Claude, Doug, Nora,
        and Ruth were in the subgroup that directed the research.
        <!--(For example, the comparison plots shown above are made by Ruth.)-->
        The rest of the coauthors of the last paper of the trilogy were involved
        in the project mainly at the stage of generating lattice-QCD data.
        The work was also influenced by Prof. Marteen Beneke because of his
        valuable comments on the first paper of the trilogy.
        </p>

        <p>From the numerical point of view, the lattice-QCD data that I worked
        with in 2015 were not as <em>clean</em> as the final data that I used
        in 2018 when the last paper of the trilogy was published.
        During those years my colleagues, especially Doug, generated more
        lattice data, which improved the statistics.
        As the statistics improved, his analyses evolved and led to
        <em>cleaner</em> data.
        Moreover, Doug and Claude investigated the effect of freezing of
        topological charge on the lattice data, and they incorporated their
        results in the analysis.
        </p>

        <p>Along with improving the lattice-QCD statistics,
        the model that I used for fitting the data evolved during the project
        from a very simple model to a <em>sophisticated</em> one.
        The model initially was designed to yield only the charm and bottom
        quark masses without including the light quark masses
        and their effects in simulations.
        As an intermediate quark mass, we first employed the <em>kinetic</em>
        mass and, later on, the <em>renormalon-subtracted</em> mass.
        Both of these intermediate masses were employed to circumvent
        the so-called renormalon divergence in the <em>pole</em> mass of
        quarks.
        None of them led to satisfying results, so I decided to improve the
        model by investigating the renormalon divergence in the pole mass.</p>

        <p>My efforts to improve the model led to the first and second papers of
        the trilogy.
        In the first one, I investigated the pattern of the renormalon divergence
        in the pole mass and found a recursive relation that governs the
        large-order behavior of the pole mass in perturbation theory, leading
        to the renormalon divergence. Based on the recursive relations, 
        I obtained a sum rule to calculate the overall strength
        of the renormalon divergence and incorporated the result in the model.
        In the second paper of the trilogy,
        I investigated two aspects of relating the mass
        of a heavy-light meson to the masses of its quark-antiquark components.
        First, I introduced a novel definition for a quark
        mass, the minimal-renormalon-subtracted (MRS) mass, which was free
        from the shortcomings of the other intermediate masses used
        initially in the work.
        Using a skeleton of effective field theories, which was originally
        developed by Claude and I for
        the <a href=#decay_constants>decay constant</a> project,
        and employing the MRS mass, I presented a sophisticated, practical
        formula to relate meson masses to quark masses.
        After I finished the draft,
        Andreas' eloquence improved the draft to a very well-written one.
        Antonio's and Nora's critical reading of the draft and valuable comments
        polished the draft such that it left the referee nothing to object to.
        The paper also benefited from Claude's suggestions in its early
        stages.
        </p>

        <p>
        Let me now highlight a part of the second paper related to the MRS mass
        <blockquote> As explained in Ref.
            [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4757-0435-8_1">73</a>],
            "an asymptotic series ... is a compact encoding of a function,
            and its divergence should be regarded not as a deficiency but
            as a source of information about the [underlying] function."
            The crucial point here is that, equipped with the overall
            normalization [<a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/1507484">8</a>],
            we could decode the divergence due to the
            leading infrared renormalon in the pole mass. Then we could
            recover the contribution of this renormalon in the form of the
            nonperturbative function \(J_\text{MRS}(\bar m)\),
            which has a convergent expansion in powers of the reciprocal of
            \(\alpha_s(\bar m)\), rather than in powers of \(\alpha_s(\bar m)\)
            itself.
        </blockquote>
        <br>
        The title of Ref [73] in the above passage is
        "<em>Asymptotics, Superasymptotics, Hyperasymptotics...</em>",
        and my familiarity with these subjects (due to my work with Prof. Carl
        Bender) allowed me to provide a simple, transparent way of handling
        the renormalon divergence in the pole mass without a need to introduce
        a cutoff scale.
        </p>


        <p>I conclude this part by mentioning that our determination of quark
        masses attracted widespread attention, including an invitation
        to address the plenary session of the 36th International Symposium on
        Lattice Field Theory (2018) and the plenary session of XIIIth
        Conference on Quark Confinement and the Hadron Spectrum (2018).
        Furthermore, I contributed to a review paper:
        <ol start=4>
            <li><a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/1788480">
                <em>Strong coupling constant and quark masses from lattice
                QCD</em>,</a>
            </li>
        </ol>
        and created a python module, called
        <a href="https://github.com/jkomijani/meson_mass"> <em>meson_mass</em></a>,
        that contains effective formulas to describe the mass of heavy-light
        pseudoscalar mesons.

        <p>I have been one of the key contributors of a project by
        the FNAL and MILC collaboration on the determination of decay constants
        of heavy-light mesons using lattice-QCD simulations.
        In short, these decay constants are useful in the search for New Physics
        beyond the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model">Standard Model</a>,
        and that's why it was an important project.

        <p>A trilogy of papers describe my work related to this project:
        <ol>
         <li><a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/1254568">
             <em>Chiral Perturbation Theory for All-Staggered Heavy-Light
                 Mesons,</em></a>
         </li>

         <li><a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/1306303">
            <em>Charmed and light pseudoscalar meson decay constants from
                four-flavor lattice QCD with physical light quarks,</em></a>
         </li>

         <li><a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/1644910">
                 <em>B- and D-meson leptonic decay constants from four-flavor
                     lattice QCD</em>.</a>
         </li>
        </ol>
        The first paper of the trilogy is my first paper with Claude,
        and it outlines the skeleton of effective field theories (EFT) used in
        this project and also the <a href=#quark_masses>quark masses</a> project.
        The technique of constructing EFTs is very powerful in tackling problems
        with several scales such as problems involving very heavy and/or very
        light quarks.
        The effective theory that we developed in that paper was a combination
        of three EFTs: Symanzik effective theory for small lattice spacing,
        chiral perturbation theory for small light-quark masses, and heavy
        quark effective theory for large heavy-quark masses.
        I learned these effective field theories when I started working with
        Claude at the end of the first year of my Ph.D. studies.
        He patiently taught these theories to me and guided me to apply these
        theories in the statistical analysis of lattice-QCD data.
        </p>


        <p>Applications of the results of the first paper
        led to the second paper of the trilogy published in
        2014, using a part of the data, and to the third one published in 2018,
        using the complete set of the data. (The lattice data used in this project
        were generated by the MILC collaboration during more than six years:
        before 2012 till the end of 2017.)
        In the third paper, we presented the most precise determination 
        of the \( D \) and \( B \) meson decay constants and their ratios.
        Our results for the \( B \) meson decay constants were three times more precise
        than the previous best lattice-QCD calculations, and brought the QCD
        errors in the standard model predictions for the rare leptonic decays 
        \(B_s \to \mu^+ \mu^-,\)
        \(B^0 \to \mu^+ \mu^-,\)
        and their ratios to well below other sources of uncertainty.
        </p>

        <p>I should emphasize that the work published in the second and third
        papers included several layers of heavy computations and analyses.
        The first layer, done by the MILC collaboration,
        was generating lattice-QCD ensembles and measuring the
        so-called two-point correlators on the lattices.
        The second layer was to statistically analyze the correlators,
        followed by a layer of analysis that included scale setting and
        determination of the ratio of light quark masses,
        namely the ratio of the average of the up and down
        quark masses to the strange quark mass.
        Doug performed those layers of analyses.
        In a parallel process mainly led by Claude,
        the ratio of the up and down quark masses was
        determined using a lattice setup that included both QCD and QED
        effects. Andreas, Claude, Doug, Ruth, and I were on the committee of
        the project,
        and I was the main force in performing the next layers
        up to calculating the decay constants in the continuum limit.
        (Claude was my Ph.D. supervisor when we wrote the second paper of the
        trilogy, and Andreas was my postdoctoral mentor when we wrote the
        third one.)
        By the way, the phenomenological aspects of the project were worked out
        by Ruth.

        <p>
        A part of the analyses was common between this project and
        my other project on the determination of
        <a href=#quark_masses>quark masses</a>, described above.

        <p>My Ph.D. thesis contained two completely independent parts.
        The idea of nonlinear eigenvalue problems was the subject of the
        second part, which was my research under the supervision of
        Prof. Carl Bender.
        We published two papers
        <ol>
         <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1088/1751-8113/47/23/235204">
                 <em>Nonlinear Eigenvalue Problems</em>,</a>
         </li>
        
         <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1088/1751-8113/48/47/475202">
                 <em>Painleve Transcendents and PT-Symmetric Hamiltonians</em>,</a>
         </li>
        </ol>

        during my Ph.D. studies.
        In these papers, we introduced the idea of a nonlinear eigenvalue
        problem by investigating three nonlinear differential equations.

        <p>We found that, for each equation, there are one or more discrete
        sets of initial conditions that lead to unstable separatrix behavior.
        We identified these discrete sets as eigenvalues of the corresponding
        problems and worked out their asymptotic behaviors by reducing
        each problem to a linear one.</p>

        <p>Let me give a chronological report about this project.
        The whole project started from one of Carl's lectures on advanced
        mathematical methods in the Fall semester of 2012;
        the <em>''Physics 503''</em> course.
        One day he talked about the first Paineleve equation
        and explained a phenomenon that is shown in Fig. 4.9 of his book.
        I tried to understand the phenomenon using a simpler equation:
        the Ricatti equation. Right after his lecture, I asked him if
        the Ricatti equation shows the same phenomenon, and he told me
        something along the lines of:
        <em>why don't you solve the equation numerically to find out what happens?</em>
        </p>

        <p>I tackled both the Ricatti and the first Painleve equations
        and showed the results to Carl.
        He immediately realized that the initial values (or slopes)
        follow an algebraic asymptotic form.
        By the way, the solutions resembled quantum wave functions, and thus
        we called the initial values/slopes as the <em>eigenvalues</em>
        of the problem.
        Later on, I extended the study to the second Painleve equation
        and found similar behavior.
        Carl suggested me to investigate a simpler equation:
        \( y'(x) = \cos(\pi xy) \),
        which is a first-order nonlinear differential equation, unlike the
        Painleve equations that are second order.
        (This equation was given as an exercise in the text by Bender and Orszag.)

        <p>Our numerical investigation indicated that the eigenvalues of
        \( y'(x) = \cos (xy) \)
        asymptotically grow as 
        \( A \sqrt{n} \),
        and we used Richardson extrapolation to calculate the coefficient
        \( A \)
        to an accuracy of one part in
        \( 10^{10} \)
        and we conjectured reliably that 
        \( A = 2^{5/6} \).
        At this point, Carl told me to solve the problem analytically
        because, as he told, the coefficient \( A \)
        cannot be an algebraic number, unless there is an analytic solution
        to the problem.
        I could find an analytic solution by reducing the problem to
        a one-dimensional random-walk problem.</p>

        In addition to Carl and me,
        <!--a href=https://www.city.ac.uk/about/people/academics/andreas-fring>
            Andreas Fring</a-->
        Prof. Andreas Fring
        contributed to the first paper (mainly to the numerical aspects).
        We published the first paper, and we returned to the asymptotic
        behavior of the eigenvalues of the first and second Painleve equations,
        both numerically and analytically. We realized there is a deep
        connection between the nonlinear eigenvalues of these two equations
        and corresponding PT-symmetric Hamiltonians,
        and we published the results in the second paper.
        (Interestingly, I was supposed to work with Carl on
        PT-symmetric QFT in 2011, but Carl went on sabbatical leave,
        and when he returned in the Fall of 2012, I could not work with him
        because I was deeply occupied by my project with Claude.
        Incidentally, my question eventually returned me to the PT-symmetric
        world!)</p>


        <p>
        Carl and I continued our work. Here are three more papers that we have
        published after my Ph.D. studies:
        <ol start=3>
            <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1088/1751-8121/ab2bcc">
                <em>Nonlinear eigenvalue problems for generalized Painleve
                equations</em>,</a>
            </li>

            <li><a href="https://inspirehep.net/literature/1881630">
                <em>Fourth Painleve Equation and PT-Symmetric
                Hamiltonians</em>,</a>
            </li>

            <li><a href="https://inspirehep.net/literature/1877706">
                <em>First-order nonlinear eigenvalue problems and random walk in
                one dimension</em>,</a>
            </li>
        </ol>
        where the first one is written in collaboration with
        <a href=https://academictree.org/physics/peopleinfo.php?pid=482992>
            Qinghai Wang</a>
        with minimal contribution from me.
        The next one is an addendum to our earlier paper on Painleve equations,
        and the last one discusses nonlinear eigenvalue problems associated
        with many special functions such as the Bessel, Airy, reciprocal gamma,
        and Riemann zeta functions.</p>
